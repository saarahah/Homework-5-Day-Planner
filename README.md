# Homework-5-Day-Planner

For this day planner I used JQuery, Javascript, MomentJS and Bootstrap to put together a user interactable calendar.
The calendar goes from 9AM to 5PM and has slots in which a user can input daily tasks. 
At the end of each slot is a save button which stores the task in local storage to be retrieved after every load.
